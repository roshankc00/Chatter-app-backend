#Core Features:

1. REST API for User Management

- Create a RESTful API that allows users to register, login, logout, and manage their profiles.
- Use Node.js variables effectively to handle data processing and response generation.

2. Real-Time Chat Application

- Implement a chat feature using WebSockets that allows authenticated users to communicate in real-time.
- Ensure the chat is persistent, meaning messages are saved and can be retrieved later.

#Optional Feature: 3. Video Streaming Capability

- If possible, add a feature that allows one-to-one video calling.
- You may use any reliable Node.js library or package that supports video streaming.

#Project Requirements:

- Your code should follow MVC architecture and best practices for node development.
- The application must be secure, with proper authentication and authorization checks for the API and chat features.
- Provide clear documentation on how to set up and run your project, including any environment setup and external dependencies.
